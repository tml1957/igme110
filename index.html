            <p>There is no denying the fact that the Nintendo Wii stands as a successful gaming console. From its release in November of 2006, it has not only become the third highest-selling home console of all time, but on record the Wii has changed the lives of many ill-abled consumers. This achievement is in large part thanks to the Wii Remote controller, the system’s native motion control hardware. In fact, the Wii marked the first mainstream console to primarily feature motion controls. The controller inspired many people to get moving which led way to multiple breakthroughs in physical rehabilitation and healthy routine exercise. More importantly, the unique technology was extremely effective at bringing people together, whether they liked video games or not. Looking back at my own childhood, I distinctly remember the Wii acting as a catalyst for my entire family getting up and moving on cold Sunday mornings. However ,others have gone on to claim that the Wii’s use of motion controls was “gimmicky” and a cash grab that ignited the interactive media industry to push out low quality games featuring poorly realized motion controls. In the midst of the debate there sits the Wii, the spark that lit the wildfire, was it the console that was responsible for this ugly slew of negative trends? Well that’s certainly the sensationalist perspective. To some, it can be said that the harm the Wii brought to the industry outweighed the good. But to me, the message was clear: the Nintendo Wii’s introduction of motion controls into the mainstream helped different kinds of people from all walks of life, thus making it the most important and beneficial development in the history of interactive media.</p>
