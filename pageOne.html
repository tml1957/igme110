            <h1>Captivating an Audience</h1>
            <p>Now to state that the Wii, “brought people together” is a vague claim to say the least. <br><br><br><br>When referring to interactive media it’s important to ask what exactly it means to unite one and another with your technology. To start answering this question, I find that it would be easy to point to the raw numerical success of the Wii. To reiterate, the Nintendo Wii is the third highest-selling home console of all time, sitting comfortably at 101.63 million units sold (Nintendo, 2019). Many theorize what stimulated the Wii into becoming a great success for the company, lay in the system’s unique use of a motion control scheme. Guinness World Records echo this thought while also adding that motion controls appeal to everybody. Author Mike Plant states, “the Wii catapulted Nintendo back into the industry with its unique motion controls and Wii Sports appealing to gamers and non-gamers alike.” (Plant, 2018). <br><br>This fresh and captivating technology, paired with an incredible marketing push, was able to tap into and appeal toward a massive audience of people and become its own social platform. <br><br>In his book, Codename Revolution: The Nintendo Wii Platform, author Steven E Jones studied the social experience of the Wii. He went on to write, “the Wii encourages interactions in the shared space of the living room, both kinds of casual gaming work by tracking what the player does in different kinds of social spaces, and creating a feedback loop between those player actions and the digital games.” (Jones and Thiruvathukal, 2012) When it comes to interactive media, many companies long for this idea of uniting a casual and experienced audience as explained by both Plant and Jones. Nintendo’s philosophy when it came to bringing together the divide in the gaming audience was simply to start fresh. <br><br>So how did Nintendo, “bring people together?” With every consumer being introduced to the ground breaking technology at the same time, that would mean no person should feel intimidated or put off by their own inexperience. Nintendo made sure that accessibility remained a forefront of the Wii’s design. But then of course, Microsoft and Sony, industry competitors to Nintendo, were soon inclined to match the Wii’s self-sustaining guerilla marketing campaign. <br><br>As Stephen Totilo from Kotaku put it, “The Wii won acceptance in the way the PlayStation and Xbox did not. Motion control got it there. The idea of swinging your arm to play a game got it there.” (Totilo, 2013). <br><br>With that on the table, it is my whole-hearted belief that it was a similar thought process that got Microsoft and Sony into the Motion Control war. Unfortunately their attempts didn’t quite grasp the concept of being accessible.</p>
