            <h1>The Miracle of Motion Controls</h1>
            <p>There is one thing that remains a crucial benefit to motion control gaming: the motion. The Nintendo Wii was a miniature revolution in both the fields of physical rehabilitation and personal health. The ability to pick up a controller and have fun moving your body was another miracle on Nintendo’s behalf. The Wii was a joyous beacon of hope among the overweight, elderly, and disabled. <br><br>This is in large part thanks to the Wii Remote’s design philosophy and the Wii’s other form of motion control in the Wii Fit Balance Board. The balance board was a pack-in device with the game, Wii Fit. The purpose of the game and the board was to encourage people to lead a healthy lifestyle through fun movement. While similar to purpose of the Wii Remote, the Wii Fit Balance Board was a piece of hardware dedicated to fitness related usage. With a title like Wii Fit, you can tell that the target audience was unhealthy or overweight gamers looking to get back in shape. Which judging by a total of roughly 18.22 million in sales, it’s safe to say that Wii Fit was a success in reaching its demographic. <br><br>Yet to assume that overweight players were the only ones to benefit from the Wii Remote and Wii Fit Balance Board, is a vast understatement. Whether it was planned by Nintendo or not, the recovery and rehabilitation potential from their technology was monumental. <br><br>In a study conducted by Dara Meldrum, she wanted to see how effective and enjoyable the Wii Fit Balance Board was in physical therapy for those with balance impairment. After coming to the final results, she drew the conclusion, “This study has quantified the usability of the NWFP as a treatment for balance impairment showing high levels of usability and enjoyment with no serious adverse effects. The results of this study may assist physiotherapists in devising novel balance rehabilitation programmes.” (Meldrum, 2011).  <br><br>In other words, the study showed that not only were motion controls effective for rehabilitation, but also enjoyable too. The best part about this, is that the technology isn’t limited to hospitals, so anyone wishing to improve their balance can run to the store and pick up a Wii. Another problem that the Wii was able to support was the ongoing crisis of damaging falls in nursing homes. Of the near 2 million elderly in nursing homes, about half have experienced a falling incident. Within this half, eleven percent have gone on to sustain injuries. <br><br>In order to test how the Wii could be used clinically, Robert Clark and Theresa Kraemer conducted a similar study to Meldrum. They tested the balance of volunteers and then asked them to play bowling in Wii Sports for a couple short bursts. When all was said and done, their results showed, “ Outcomes: After 6 one-hour treatment sessions, the patient's Berg Balance Score improved from 48 to 53. On the Dynamic Gait Index, the patient improved her score from 19 to 21. The patient's Timed Up and Go Test improved from 14.9 to 10.5 seconds, all suggesting a reduced risk of falling.” (Clark and Kraemer, 2009). <br><br>With all of this in mind, it’s still surprising to think that a video game console was able to spark as many benefits as it did. This is why I believe the Wii to be so important to interactive media. While at first motion controls can seem like a gimmick, the ingenious design of the system sparked hope in the least likely ways. Although some may still want to go on and argue that the Wii couldn’t have helped all these people because motion controls are inaccurate.</p>
